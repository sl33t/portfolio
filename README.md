# My Portfolio Website: [RickyCatron.com](http://www.RickyCatron.com) 
This is my development porfolio site. 
It is built on Django utilizing a Postgres database.
It is hosted on Webfaction and encrypted using LetsEcrypt.
I am currently learning about testing, continuous integration, and a wide variety of other technologies.
I try to integrate them into this but not so much that it overcomplicates the project.
Right now Travis handles testing and deployment.
I hope you enjoy my site.
